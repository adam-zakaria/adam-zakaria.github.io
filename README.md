# Static Site
We don't use a static site generator - we just create a static site. I guess using word press would make it a dynamic site? Sending requests to the backend. Though there are WordPress site generators. We just need something showable that show Cliptu and Polyglot - it's that simple. But...learning a bit of graphic design, it'll take a little bit.
